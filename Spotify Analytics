### In this project, I downloaded a Spotify csv file with data from the following webpage on Kaggle
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv
# I then created a table in SQLite to insert the Spotify data and perform Analytics on the data

# Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table in SQLite

# Next, I ran some queries to analyse some data in the table

# First I found the average danceability by artist and track
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

# Secondly I ran a query to find the top 10 artists based on popularity
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Thirdly, I determined what artist released the longest song
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

# Then I queried the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs
SELECT track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# In this query, I created a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the average popularity for the artists in the table. 
# Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I pull their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH average_popularity_CTE AS (
SELECT AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity, 
s.artist_name
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS Tag
FROM average_popularity_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
