# In this dataset, I worked on a project which represents a digital media store and 
# includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customer.


-- In this query, I used a simple SELECT statement to show customer information who are not in the US:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country !='USA';


-- For this query, I brought up the total Invoices in 2009
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId), InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


-- Here, I wrote a query to show the invoices associated with each sales agent
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


-- For this query I created a CTE (Common Table Expression) to show the top salesman who have had
-- a total sales figure of 100 or more, and labelled them as 'Top Salesman'
WITH top_sales_CTE AS (
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total)) AS total_sales, emp.FirstName, 
emp.LastName
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
JOIN employees emp ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
)
SELECT FirstName, LastName, total_sales,
'Top Salesman' AS Tag FROM average_sales_CTE
WHERE total_sales>=100;
